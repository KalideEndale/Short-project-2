INTRODUCTION:
In 2004, the NCAA developed a metric that measures a team's academic success in order to hold institutions accountable for the academic progress of their student athletes. This metric was called Academic Progress Rate(APR). APR measures student athletes that receive athletically related financial aid and assigns points for grades and retention. A perfect team score is 1000 and a score below 930 (equivalent to 50%  graduation rate) means teams could face severe penalties by the NCAA--if score doesn't improve. The cumulative team score is what will be used to measure the academic performance of a sports team. This scoring index helps the NCAA reward institutions for high academic performances and penalizes institutions that don't prepare their student athletes for life post college. In my analysis below, i will try and look into at how APR scoring has improved over time and if some sport teams are generally higher academic performers than others.
